          <p class="lead">Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first
              classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,
              datepickers.</p>
          <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
              you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
          <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                  Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
              bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
              Tailwind CSS.</p>

          <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
          <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
              Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
              documentation.</p>
